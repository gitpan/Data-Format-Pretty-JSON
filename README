NAME
    Data::Format::Pretty::JSON - Pretty-print data structure as JSON

VERSION
    version 0.08

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Format::Pretty::JSON qw(format_pretty);
     print format_pretty($data);

    Some example output:

    *   format_pretty({a=>1, b=>2})

          1:{
          2:    "a" : 1,
          3:    "b" : 2,
          4:}

        By default color is turned on (unless forced off via "COLOR"
        environment) as well as pretty printing (unless turned off via
        pretty=>1) and line numbers (unless when pretty=>0 or turned off by
        linum=>0).

    *   format_pretty({a=>1, b=>2}, {pretty=>0});

         {"a":1,"b":2}
