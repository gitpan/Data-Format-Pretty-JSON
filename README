NAME
    Data::Format::Pretty::JSON - Pretty-print data structure as JSON

VERSION
    version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Format::Pretty::JSON qw(format_pretty);
     print format_pretty($data);

    Some example output:

    *   format_pretty({a=>1, b=>2})

          1:{
          2:    "a" : 1,
          3:    "b" : 2,
          4:}

        By default color is turned on when interactive (unless forced off
        via color=>0 or environment "COLOR=0"). By default pretty printing
        is turned on (unless turned off via pretty=>0) and line numbers
        (unless turned off via when pretty=>0). By default line numbers are
        printed when interactive (unless turned off via by linum=>0 or
        environment "LINUM=0").

    *   format_pretty({a=>1, b=>2}, {pretty=>0});

         {"a":1,"b":2}
